            <p class="description-pescheria">
              La Pescheria (Piscarìa in Sicilian) is the ancient fish market of
              the city of Catania and is included in the tourist route for the
              folklore content that you breathe passing among the fishmongers'
              stalls.
            </p>
            <p class="description-pescheria">
              Only by trying this experience can one realize how picturesque
              this market can be, which can only be compared in the twin market
              of the Vucciria in Palermo: the market is always crowded and the
              incessant shouting (la vuciata) of the sellers creates an Arab
              souk background and you can breathe the typical atmosphere of a
              medina quarter.

                <h4>Catania</h4>
                <p>
                  Catania is an ancient port city on the east coast of Sicily.
                  It is located at the foot of Etna, an active volcano with
                  paths that reach its summit. The large central square of the
                  city, Piazza del Duomo, is characterized by the picturesque
                  statue of the Elephant Fountain and the richly decorated
                  Cathedral. In the southwest corner of the square, La
                  Pescheria, the fish market held on weekdays, is a noisy
                  spectacle surrounded by restaurants serving fish.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In 2015, the new path of the terraces and the dome of the
                  Church of the Badia di Sant’Agata was opened to the public. A
                  careful restoration work has allowed the people of Catania and
                  tourists to regain possession of this space overlooking the
                  city at 360 °, from the sea to the mountains.

                <p>
                  Palermo is the capital of Sicily. The 12th-century Cathedral
                  of Palermo houses royal tombs, while the imposing neoclassical
                  Teatro Massimo is famous for its opera performances. Also in
                  the center are the Palazzo dei Normanni, a royal palace dating
                  back to the 9th century, and the Palatine Chapel, with
                  Byzantine mosaics. Busy markets include the central street
                  market Ballarò and the Vucciria, near the port.

                  Mondello is now a small seaside resort hidden under the
                  northern slope of Monte Pellegrino. It used to be a
                  fishermen's village centered around a 15th-century tower.
                  However, the last century has turned it into a stately and
                  green villa district. The golden years of the town began at
                  the end of the 19th century, when a town was founded here,
                  where wealthy Sicilians built villas. The Art Nouveau baths
                  built on stilts in the sea also come from this period.

                <h4>Agrigento</h4>
                <p>
                  Agrigento is a hilly city on the southwestern coast of Sicily.
                  It is known for the ruins of the ancient city of Akragas and
                  the Valley of the Temples, a vast archaeological site with
                  well-preserved Greek temples. On the outskirts of the modern
                  city is the Agrigento Regional Archaeological Museum which
                  houses artifacts and a telamon (giant male statue). To the
                  west is the Scala dei Turchi, an unusual white stepped cliff
                  overlooking sandy beaches.
                </p>

                <h5>Visit</h5>
                <p>
                  The Valley of the Temples is an archaeological park in Sicily
                  characterized by an exceptional state of conservation and a
                  series of important Doric temples from the Hellenic period. It
                  corresponds to the ancient Akragas, a monumental original
                  nucleus of the city of Agrigento. Since 2000 it has been a
                  regional archaeological park.
